# The Art of CSS Grid Layout

CSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout system for the web.

## Creating a Simple Grid

It's easy to get started with Grid.

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
  gap: 10px;
}

.item {
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
  padding: 20px;
  text-align: center;
}
```

## Important Grid Properties

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `display: grid` | Defines the element as a grid container. |
| `grid-template-columns` | Defines the columns of the grid. |
| `grid-template-rows` | Defines the rows of the grid. |
| `gap` | Defines the space between grid items. |

## Common Patterns

1.  **The Holy Grail Layout:** A classic layout with a header, footer, main content, and sidebars.
2.  **RAM (Repeat, Auto, Minmax):** A powerful technique for responsive grids.
3.  **Masonry Layout:** A staggered grid effect.

CSS Grid is a game-changer for web design.

# Mastering React Hooks: A Deep Dive

React Hooks have revolutionized how we write components. Let's explore them.

## The `useState` Hook

The `useState` hook is a Hook that allows you to have state variables in functional components.

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Rules of Hooks

There are two important rules to follow when using Hooks:

- Only call Hooks at the top level.
- Only call Hooks from React functions.

## Hooks vs. Classes

| Feature | Hooks (Functional Components) | Class Components |
| --- | --- | --- |
| State | `useState()` | `this.state` / `this.setState()` |
| Lifecycle | `useEffect()` | `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, etc. |
| Code Reuse | Custom Hooks | Higher-Order Components (HOCs) / Render Props |

This is just the beginning of what you can do with Hooks!

# Getting Started with Rust

Rust is a language that is both fast and memory-safe.

## Ownership

Ownership is Rust's most unique feature. It enables Rust to make memory safety guarantees without needing a garbage collector.

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let s2 = s1;
    // println!("{}, world!", s1); // This would fail! s1 is moved.
    println!("{}, world!", s2);
}
```

## Key Benefits

*   **Performance:** Rust is blazingly fast and memory-efficient.
*   **Reliability:** The compiler's strictness prevents common bugs.
*   **Productivity:** Great tooling and a thoughtful compiler.

## Rust vs. C++

| Aspect | Rust | C++ |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Memory Safety | Guaranteed by compiler | Manual memory management |
| Concurrency | Built-in, fearless concurrency | Complex, error-prone |
| Package Manager | Cargo (built-in) | None (requires external tools) |

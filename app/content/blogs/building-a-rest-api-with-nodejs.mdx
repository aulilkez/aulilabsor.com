# Building a REST API with Node.js and Express

Node.js and Express are a powerful combination for building APIs.

## Setting up the Server

Here's a basic Express server setup.

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Example app listening at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

## HTTP Methods

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `GET` | Retrieve data |
| `POST` | Create data |
| `PUT` | Update data |
| `DELETE` | Delete data |

## API Best Practices

*   Use nouns for resource names (e.g., `/users`).
*   Use status codes correctly (e.g., `200 OK`, `404 Not Found`).
*   Version your API (e.g., `/api/v1/users`).
